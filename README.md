# Tic-Tac-Toe
This is a 5x5 Tic-Tac-Toe game, created in Unity, where players competes against the computer. I developed an algorithm that interactively challenges the player.

Download this project to play this game by running the TicTacToe executable. I challenge you to try and beat the algorithm.

Please contact me for inquiries about the source code.
